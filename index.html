    <h1>Flight Data Analysis of a Major Metropolitan Area</h1>
    
    <h2>Data Source:</h2>
    <p>
        For this analysis, flight data related to a major metropolitan area was used. The dataset was sourced from the NYCflights13 package, which provides details about flights departing from NYC in the year 2013.
    </p>

    <h2>Summary Statistics & Visual Insights:</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Distribution of Departure Delays by Airline Carrier:</h3>

    <p>
        From this visual, it is evident that:
        <ul>
            <li>Some carriers have more spread in their delays, indicating variability in their performance.</li>
            <li>While certain carriers show tight clusters around the median, others have noticeable outliers, with extreme cases of departure delays.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>2. Density of Flight Distance vs. Arrival Delay:</h3>
    <img src="Plot 2.png" alt="Density of Flight Distance vs. Arrival Delay">
    <p>
        Insights derived:
        <ul>
            <li>Most of the flights have distances less than 2000 miles with arrival delays clustered below 100 minutes.</li>
            <li>Flights that travel greater distances (more than 3000 miles) seem to have more variability in arrival delays.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>3. Top 20 Airports with the Highest Average Delays:</h3>
    <img src="Plot 3.png" alt="Top 20 Airports with the Highest Average Delays">
    <p>
        Key Takeaways:
        <ul>
            <li>CAE, TUL, and OKC are the top three airports with the highest average delays.</li>
            <li>There is a gradual decrease in delay times as we move down the list, highlighting the disparity between the top delay-prone airports and the rest.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Storytelling & Open Questions:</h2>
    <p>
        The presented visuals provide a comprehensive understanding of flight delays, both from an airline carrier and airport perspective. Questions that arise include:
        <ul>
            <li>Which carriers should passengers potentially avoid if they're wary of delays?</li>
            <li>Is there a correlation between flight distance and arrival delay?</li>
            <li>Which airports are notorious for causing delays?</li>
        </ul>
        Such questions are crucial for stakeholders, from passengers to airline companies, to make informed decisions.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
    <p>
        This analysis provides a snapshot of flight delays in a major metropolitan area. By identifying carriers and airports with high delays, stakeholders can make better decisions, and relevant authorities can take corrective actions to improve efficiency.
